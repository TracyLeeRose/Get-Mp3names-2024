# Get-Mp3names-2024
What the project does: Gets and sorts all MP3 music titles from your directory and puts them in a TXT file
It it is simple command prompt that asks for a directory path.  After sorting mp3 names it will beep to show complete.

Why the project is useful:  I keep 4000 songs on a thumbdrive in my car.  This helps know what songs I can call on
other than just favorites.  Plus one can share what mp3's they have with friends

How users can get started with the project:  Use the MSI install to put files into a folder you create
then run it via EXE file
