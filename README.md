# Get-Mp3names-2024
What the project does: Gets and sorts all MP3 music titles from your directory and puts them in a TXT file
It it is simple command prompt that asks for a directory path.  After sorting mp3 names it will beep to show complete.

++ counts all MP3 and loser case mp3 extensions
++ counts songs missing delimiters but then lists them for you to fix in renaming
 -- puts no delimiter song names in MUSIC text file in that directory.
++ shows you how many images you have TOTAL at the bottom of the Alphabetized file
++ give you a 'rating' of how crappy your music might be

Why the project is useful:  I keep 4000 songs on a thumbdrive in my car.  This helps know what songs I can call on
other than just favorites.  Plus one can share what mp3's they have with friends

How users can get started with the project:  
++ Use the MSI install to put files into a folder you create
then run it via EXE file. All library files are installed into the folder you choose.

++ Assure you install as for EVERYONE so the permissions work on the computer

Who maintains and contributes to the project:  No one it's just an experiment now done

NOTE: Once you have extracted this into a folder for use, scan it for safety as always 
but be sure to tell your virus checker it's a safe file for future scans. My virus
checker hates floating EXE files in the system.
